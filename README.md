# M3PW-Offline

This is a programming project which has lasted for about 3 years to this day. This document will discuss a brief introduction of the project, instructions on how to compile the project on your own computer, and its history in detail.

Introduction

The project I am working on is called M3PW, which is short for Mr. Mitchell's Magic Physics World. The history behind this name is long but, to make things brief, this game does not focus on answering physics problems. In the end the game should be able to transition to a server/client application. I imagine somewhat a cross between Runescape and MapleStory for its gameplay, but it can probably be expanded. I still need more ideas.

How to compile the project

To compile the project, some configuration and the SDL 1.2 library is required.

1. Make sure that the SDL 1.2 library is installed.
  Note:  Download is available at https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php

2. Compile all the sources in the root directory.
  Note: The makefile can be configured to use your compiler. The makefile is currently set to use g++.
